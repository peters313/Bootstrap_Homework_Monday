        <h3>Batman</h3>
        <p>Batman doesn't have the ability to fly or super-strength or even super-speed. But that doesn't mean he is any less of a hero. In fact, his punch is said to be stronger than most super-humans.
		Because he is a billionaire, Bruce can buy and use many weapons his company, Waynetech, creates. Batman has many gadgets and weapons at his disposal. </p>

        <h3>Deadpool</h3>
        <p>Not much is known about Wade Wilson's past. What is known is that he was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and in a last ditch effort to save his life, Wade volunteered for the Weapon-X Program. His life was saved as the Program granted him a powerful healing factor, copied from a former test subject, Wolverine. The cancer went into remission. Wade's life was saved, but his mind shattered. 

		Wade took the name Deadpool and became one of the world's top mercenaries. Capable of recovering from almost any form of injury, Deadpool is a formidable opponent, even defeating the assassin Taskmaster, a villain who has defeated the Avengers on numerous occasions, with one arm tied behind his back.</p>
